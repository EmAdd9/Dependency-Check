# Setting up OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins

OWASP Dependency Check is a valuable software composition analysis (SCA) tool designed to detect vulnerabilities within project dependencies. This guide outlines the steps to integrate OWASP Dependency Check into your Jenkins environment, helping developers and security professionals identify and address potential risks associated with using insecure libraries and components.

## Installation

To incorporate OWASP Dependency Check into Jenkins, follow these simple steps:

1. Launch Jenkins and access the Jenkins home page.
2. Click on "Manage Jenkins" on the left-hand sidebar.
3. Choose "Manage Plugins" from the menu.
4. Within the "Available" tab, use the filter to locate "OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin."
5. Mark the checkbox beside the plugin and click the "Install without restart" button.
6. Once the installation finishes, return to the Jenkins home page.
7. Click "New Item" on the left sidebar to create a new Jenkins job.
8. Assign a name to your job and select the desired job type (e.g., Freestyle project or Pipeline).
9. Configure the job according to your needs (e.g., source code management, build triggers, etc.).
10. Scroll down to the "Build" section and click the "Add build step" dropdown.
11. Choose "Invoke OWASP Dependency-Check" from the list.
12. Customize the plugin settings to your specifications. This involves indicating the project's path, any supplementary arguments, and selecting the appropriate OWASP Dependency-Check installation.
13. Save the job configuration.

From now on, whenever you execute the Jenkins job, OWASP Dependency Check will automatically evaluate your project's dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.

**Note**: Ensure that you have set up your preferred OWASP Dependency-Check installation within Jenkins before running the job. You can achieve this by navigating to "Manage Jenkins" > "Global Tool Configuration" and adding a new OWASP Dependency Check installation.

## Option 1: Standalone JAR Download

1. Visit the OWASP Dependency Check releases page.
2. Download the latest version of the standalone JAR file (dependency-check.jar).
3. Verify that you have Java 8 or a higher version installed on your system.
4. Execute the tool using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar dependency-check.jar --project <project-name> --scan <path-to-project>
   ```

## Option 2: Utilizing Package Managers

OWASP Dependency Check is accessible through popular package managers:

- **Maven**: Integrate the following plugin into your pom.xml file:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
      <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
      <version>INSERT_VERSION_HERE</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

Execute `mvn dependency-check:check` to assess your project.

By following these steps, you'll effectively integrate OWASP Dependency Check into your Jenkins workflow, helping you proactively manage and mitigate potential security risks associated with your project's dependencies.
